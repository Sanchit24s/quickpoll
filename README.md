# QuickPoll

**Created by: Sanchit Bhoyar**

QuickPoll is a real-time polling web application that allows users to create single-question polls and share them with others. Participants can vote without signing up, and the poll creator can monitor responses and final results. Each poll remains active for a limited duration and is automatically deactivated after expiry.
